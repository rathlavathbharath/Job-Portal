# Job-Portal
Welcome to the Comprehensive Job Portal project repository! This project is a robust job portal developed for a company, utilizing an array of cutting-edge technologies including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP. The Job Portal is designed to offer an efficient and user-friendly platform for both job seekers and employers, empowering them to connect seamlessly in the job market. The portal incorporates an Admin panel that provides authentication for login/signup, a form for creating job listings, a table for displaying posted job details, and a list of candidates who have applied for jobs.
