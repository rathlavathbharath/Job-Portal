# Job-Portal
I have developed a job portal for a company utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP technologies. The portal incorporates an Admin panel that provides authentication for login/signup, a form for creating job listings, a table for displaying posted job details, and a list of candidates who have applied for jobs. 
The website showcases all the job postings from the company and includes a user-friendly application form for employers. The database enables the company to maintain a record of applied candidates, login/signup information, and posted job details.
